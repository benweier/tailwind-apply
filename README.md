# `tailwind-apply`

`tailwind-apply` is a simple combination of plugins for TailwindCSS and PostCSS. It is intended to provide a basic mechanism and structure for you to easily "apply-your-own-theme" for TailwindCSS.

It does this by extending TailwindCSS's config the same way as `@tailwindcss/typography` or `@tailwindcss/forms`, with one critical difference - _you can author custom classes in CSS/SCSS/Sass/Less **and even use `@apply`**_!

You could always [extract classes with `@apply`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles#extracting-classes-with-apply) but this doesn't integrate directly with the TailwindCSS theme, and you soon run into issues using imports and `@layer` directives due to the nature of the JIT engine.

This plugin is _**not**_ intended to replace component partials or use of TailwindCSS classes. The same [premature abstraction](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles#avoiding-premature-abstraction) caveats apply ðŸ˜Ž

## Getting Started

`require` the PostCSS plugin and point it to the folder containing your custom styles. This instructs PostCSS to treat the files in the `styles` folder as dependencies and rebuild your CSS on any changes.

```js
// postcss.config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('tailwind-apply/postcss'), // MUST come before the `tailwindcss` plugin
    require('tailwindcss'),
    require('autoprefixer'),
  ],
}
```

`require` the TailwindCSS plugin and point it to the folder containing your custom styles. This instructs TailwindCSS to extends its `theme` with the files in the `styles` folder.

```js
// tailwind.config.js

module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  plugins: [require('tailwind-apply')],
}
```

### Options

`styles`

Default: `./styles`

Set the root folder where your custom styles are located.

`pattern`

Default: `**/*.{css,scss,sass,less}`

Set the glob pattern of the files in the `styles` folder.

### Style Structure

Custom styles authored in CSS files must be arranged into sub-folders named after the layer they target:

- `base`
- `components`
- `utilities`

Files outside of these folders won't be added to your TailwindCSS theme, but could be utilised to break down your CSS modules or define CSS variables available across the rest of your theme.

```
project
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components / etc
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ styles   <-- wherever you save your custom styles and matches the path given to the plugin `styles` option
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ base   <-- classes that get added to Tailwind's `base` layer
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ headings.css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components   <-- classes that get added to Tailwind's `component` layer
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ button.css
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.css
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ navigation.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utilities   <-- added to `utilities` layer
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ content.js
â”œâ”€â”€ postcss.config.js
â””â”€â”€ tailwind.config.js
```

TailwindCSS plugins authored in JS can be located anywhere within your project folders since how they get imported into `tailwind.config.js` is up to you.

#### Example

```js
// postcss.config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('tailwind-apply/postcss')({
      styles: './src/theme', // Your styles are located in the `src/theme` folder
      pattern: '**/*.sass', // Your styles are authored in Sass only
    }),
  ],
}
```

```js
// tailwind.config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('tailwind-apply')({
      styles: './src/theme', // Your styles are located in the `src/theme` folder
      pattern: '**/*.sass', // Your styles are authored in Sass only
    }),
  ],
}
```
